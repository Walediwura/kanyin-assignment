1. Monolithic architecture is a software architecture where all the components of an application are combined into a single program or executable. In this architecture, the application is typically built as a single unit with a single codebase, and all the components are tightly coupled to each other.

2. Microservices is an architectural approach to building software applications as a collection of small, independent services, each focused on performing a single business function. In a microservice architecture, each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through lightweight mechanisms, such as HTTP/REST or messaging protocols.

3. I would say the microservice architecture because it allows for greater flexibility and agility in the development process, as changes to one service can be made without affecting the entire system. Additionally, microservices can be deployed using containerization technologies, such as Docker, which provides a lightweight and scalable way to package and deploy services.

4. No Node.js is a single-threaded language.

5. REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop.
